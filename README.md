As the application expands, please update the information here if it does not reflect the current state of the project.

* Login
* User registration (currently disabled)
* Word database REST
	* Search functionality
	* Word of the day
	* Random word and different word lists
	* Backup on the server and downloadable file

## To come:
* Word API
* Advanced search
* Advanced statistics
* Database restructuring
* More languages

## To do (ideas from YLW):
* New: Add a user with only viewing privileges
* New: Add a column "Viewed" on the words for users, that when they click it it highlights the word so they remember they have seen it. Then add a menu "Words learned" where they can see those words they have highlighted. Later, this collection of words can be used for creating flashcards, memory exercises etc
* New: An optional "advanced search", if accessed the user can specify options like which type, which language, find only matching of the search word, or start by the search word, etc
* New: Statistics: allow for search options on period of times: redraw the table for a period between two dates that can be set as parameters (between 2014-01-20 and the date of today)
* New: Statistics: in the Recently added words count, add a line for the total of the 3 lines :)

* Fix: when I search “wpl” it doesn’t return me the words containing “wpł” (= searching for “L” doesn’t give words with “Ł “ as it should)
* Fix:
